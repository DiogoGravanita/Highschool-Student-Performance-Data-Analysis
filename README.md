# Highschool Student Performance Data Analysis (Microsoft SQL Server + PowerBI)


## Introduction:

This project aims to analyze and visualize diverse high school student data using Power BI. The dataset includes various demographic factors, academic metrics, and lifestyle variables, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing student performance.


<br/><br/>

## Project Overview

### Data Source

The data set was downloaded from the following website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/high-school-student-performance-and-demographics?resource=download . The file will be added as "space_missions.csv". 

### Objectives

 1. Data Exploration: Dive deep into the dataset to understand the demographics, academic metrics, and lifestyle factors of high school students.

 2. Interactive Dashboards: Create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize key insights and trends in student performance.

 3. Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical analysis to identify correlations and relationships between various factors and academic outcomes.

<br/><br/>


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We'll focus on the following KPIs to evaluate the performance and trends of space missions:



1. Total Missions

2. Mission Success Rate

3. Average Mission Cost

4. Countries Involved

<br/><br/>


## Charts and Visualizations:

We'll create a variety of charts and visualizations to present the data effectively:



1. Mission amount by Rocket/Country/Company/Year
2. Average Price by Company
3. Successful Missions by Country/Launch Center/Company
4. Success rate by Country
5. Mission status percentage
6. Average Price by Country/Rocket/Company
7. Total Cost by Year
8. Mission by Rocket Status



<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

## Tools and Technologies:

 - Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for data manipulation and analysis.
 - PowerBI for data visualization and statistical analysis.
 - Obsidian for documentation purposes.

<br/><br/>

## Data cleaning and preparation:
<br/><br/>



### Dividing the Location column:



<br/><br/>



### FIxing Launch Site and Launch center column issues:


<br/><br/>

### Remove useless Column:


<br/><br/>

With the completion of the data cleaning process, our table is now primed for visualization. Despite encountering numerous entries with null values in the "Price" and "Time" columns, we opted to retain them for accurate mission status representation in our graphical analyses. This decision ensures that our visualizations provide a comprehensive view of mission success rates, accounting for all relevant data points. Particularly, since most of the null Price entries will be old entries, then we would be specifically removing many old values and it would greatly affect our accuracy in a negative way when it came to evaluating other dynamics not related to Time and Costs.
